# PySEBAL toolbox

This library can compute Actual EvapoTranspiration (ETa) using SEBAL model and also computes Biomass and Water productivity on biomass. The library is extensively tested on Landsat 7 and 8 data, however it should also support MODIS and PROBA-V/VIIRS. This repository is forked from Tim Hessel's repository of 3.3.7.1 version and modified especially for adding python 3 and linux support. 
The library will work in windows and linux machines, also on linux servers for big data processing.
